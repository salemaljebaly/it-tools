# IT Tools

A small collection of lightweight scripts and “manager/dev helper” tools.

## Tools

- `tools/gmail-ack-reply-bot/` — Gmail auto-acknowledgement reply bot (Google Apps Script)
- `tools/slack-reaction-mirror/` — Mirrors Slack emoji reactions (backfill by date range + live Socket Mode watch)

## Quick start

- Each tool is self-contained; open its folder and follow its `README.md`.
- Node-based tools typically run with `npm install` then `npm run <script>`.
- Google Apps Script tools run inside the Google Apps Script editor.

## Add A Tool

1. Create a folder: `tools/<tool-name>/`
2. Add a short `README.md` with setup + usage
3. Add a single bullet entry under “Tools” above
